# Project

## Project description
This project is a base python project environment configuration using uv.

## General Instructions:

- When generating new python code, please follow the following coding style:
  - Use 4 spaces for indentation.
  - Use snake_case for variable names, functions, and parameters.
  - Use PascalCase for class names.
  - Prefer functional programming paradigms where appropriate.
  - Use type hints for all functions, classes, and parameters as well as return values.
  - Use immutable data structures when possible, prefer tuples over lists.
  - Avoid modifying function arguments.
  - Use list/dict comprehensions instead of loops when possible.
  - Minimize global state and mutable variables.
  - Return new values instead of modifying existing ones.
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

## Tools usage

- context7:  when the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation, use this tool to generate the code.
- file_reader: when the user requests to read a file, use this tool to read the file.
- safe_tool: when the user requests to run a command, use this tool to run the command.
